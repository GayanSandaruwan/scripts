Requirement 1:

My Input to the automation script should be an excel/csv file. This will contain data in first 4 columns: columnA,columnB,columnC and columnD
Now taking this as input the automation script should read each row in the excel/csv file and produce an output for each row in another text file in the below format:

curl -u test:test -k https://columnA1_Value:8089/services/properties/server/general -d serverName=columnD1_value
curl -u test:test -k https://columnA1_Value:8089/services/properties/inputs/default -d serverName=columnD1_value
curl -u test:test -k https://columnA1_Value:8089/services/server/control/restart -X POST

curl -u test:test -k https://columnA2_Value:8089/services/properties/server/general -d serverName=columnD2_value
curl -u test:test -k https://columnA2_Value:8089/services/properties/inputs/default -d serverName=columnD2_value
curl -u test:test -k https://columnA2_Value:8089/services/server/control/restart -X POST

Only the column value part is dynamic and is based on the row values on the excel/csv file but the other texts are static. 

Requirement 2:
My Input to the automation script should be an excel/csv file. This file will contain data in first column only which will be hostname list.
Now taking this as input the automation script should read each row in the excel/csv file and ping each of the hostname.

(Now generally when you ping a hostname for example inputhost.svr.us.server.net, the output is generally like: Pinging test.svr.us.server.net [fe80::3960:fe38:dbc9:b3cf%10] with 32 bytes of data
But the output of the automation Script should be an excel/csv file with 5 columns and each column value should be:
columnA1 - hostname that you pinged (The value which is the input like for example: inputhost.svr.us.server.net)
columnB1 - only the first part of the full hostname that you pinged .For example in our case if you ping inputhost.svr.us.server.net, columnB1 should only contain - inputhost
columnC1 - Whatever hostname is there after the keyword - Pinging . For example in this case its is test.svr.us.server.net
columnD1 - only the first part of the full hostname in columnC1 for example in this case its - test
columnE1 - whatever is there inside the bracket . For example fe80::3960:fe38:dbc9:b3cf%10 in this case
