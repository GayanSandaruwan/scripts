In the class cop4342, we will study Unix shell programming,
Perl programming, advanced Unix tools/commands such as sed,
awk, etc. For shell programming, we will focus on the bash
shell, and for Perl, we will mostly cover the materials that are 
most commonly used. For sed, awk, and other advanced tools,
we will cover the basics so that you can start to use them.
When you need more advanced features, you can check the manuals of 
these tools.

For all the tools, we will try to provide simple examples that 
can help you to better understand the materials.
